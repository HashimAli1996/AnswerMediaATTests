To set this project up for your local environment please do the following:
- In the system environment variables please add 'standaloneResources' to the PATH variable. this folder is found in the project, same location as the README.
- Please check your current version of chrome, if he current version is 79.xxx then the tests will run. if not you will have to download the respective chromedriver for your version and place in 'standaloneResources'
- Once completed, please open the project in Visual Studio (i'm using Visual Studio community) and you will be able to run the tests from the Test Explorer
